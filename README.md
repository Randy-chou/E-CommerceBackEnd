# E-CommerceBackEnd
## Description
This project demonstrated my second forray into backend development. My goal was to make a server capable to listening for requests and then manipulate an SQL database using Object Relational Mapping via sequelize. In the end, I was able to utilize node.js in conjunction with express to set up a basic product server and database that can be interacted with using links.
